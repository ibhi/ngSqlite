Gulp Angular Seed
=================

A simple starting project for JS utilities that use Angular and want to build with Gulp. Supports minification and concatenation out of the box, with additional support for using Sass if you like.


### Instructions

Edit the config in `config/build.config.js`

Put your code in `src/js/`

Modify `src/js/module.js` to change the name of your root Angular module. I recommend using the root module variable as a global instead of messing around with lots of hard-coded Angular module names.

Install dependencies with `npm install`

To build the project, run `gulp` and you'll find your unminified and minified JS files in `/dist`
